/**
The vector3 class is a three dimensional vector that assumes all vectors are bound vectors. It has functions for most common usages, including scaling, adding, crossing, and dotting. The length of the vector is calculated after any arithmetic function. Operators are overloaded, but binary operators are not, due to unresolved issues. Any help would be grateful.

Directly accessing x, y, and z is not recommended.
